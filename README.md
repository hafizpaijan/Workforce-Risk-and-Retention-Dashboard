# Workforce-Risk-and-Retention-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive, interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to provide strategic insights into employee attrition patterns, retention risks, and key turnover drivers.

**Objective:** To empower HR managers and business leaders with data-driven tools to proactively identify high-risk employee segments, understand the root causes of turnover, and inform targeted retention strategies.

## Key Insights & Business Impact

The analysis, driven by the metrics shown in the dashboard, reveals critical patterns that demand immediate attention:

* **Elevated Attrition Risk:** The overall **Attrition Rate is 16.1%**, which falls within the typical 15%-20% range for the Tech industry but indicates a significant cost and talent loss concern.
* **Highest Risk Age Group:** The **26-35 age group** accounts for the highest volume of attrition (**116 exits**), suggesting a failure to retain employees during their prime career growth stage.
* **Salary Sensitivity:** The majority of attrition (**163 exits**) occurs in the **"Upto 5K" Salary Slab**, indicating that compensation may be a primary lever for retention improvement, particularly at entry-to-mid levels.
* **Job Role Focus:** **Laboratory Technician** and **Sales Executive** roles demonstrate the highest total attrition, demanding specific attention from department heads.
* **Gender Disparity:** **Male employees (64% of attrition)** show a disproportionately higher turnover rate compared to Female employees (36%).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

This project demonstrates strong technical proficiency across the data pipeline:

* **Data Visualization & Modeling:** **Power BI** (Creation of interactive reports, use of custom visuals, data modeling, and relationship management).
* **Calculations & Logic:** **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (Defined key measures like Attrition Rate, Avg. Age, and aggregated counts used in the visualizations).
* **Data Wrangling:** **Power Query (M Language)** and/or **Python (Pandas)** (If used for data cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values—*Highly recommended to add this step to your process*).
* **Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Descriptive Statistics, Risk Group Segmentation, and Comparative Analysis (e.g., Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition).

## 📈 Dashboard Features

The final interactive dashboard provides the following key views and analytical breakdowns, as visualized above:

* **Core Metrics:** High-level cards for **No of Employees (1.47K)**, **Attrition (237)**, **Attrition Rate (16.1%)**, **Avg. Age (36.9)**, and **Avg. Salary (6.5K)**.
* **Demographic Segmentation:** Detailed attrition analysis by **Age**, **Gender**, and **Years at Company**.
* **Role & Compensation Analysis:** Breakdown of attrition by **Salary Slab** and top-contributing **Job Roles**.
* **Job Satisfaction Matrix:** A crucial table analyzing **Job Satisfaction Levels by Job Role** to correlate sentiment data with actual turnover counts.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The next iteration of this project would focus on moving from descriptive analysis to predictive modeling:

* **Predictive Model Integration:** Implementing a **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest** model (using Python/R) to assign an individual **risk score** to each employee.
* **Cost of Attrition:** Calculating and visualizing the estimated financial cost of turnover for each department or job role.
* **Drill-Through Capabilities:** Adding drill-through pages in Power BI for detailed deep-dives into specific departments or age groups.
